This is a summery for Object Oriented Programming Course by Adel Nasim.
Screensots of the code was taken using "Carbon" tool.
I added comments to explain how the main concepts of OOP work (Inhritance - Polymorphism - Operator Overloading - Friend Functions - Abstract Class).
Hope this to be useful for all fellow developers.

Cheers
